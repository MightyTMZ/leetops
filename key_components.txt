we then put them through real life and real training on the job (a 100% simulated job)

random time during the specified work day (9:00 to 5:00 pm)
(during this time, since it is a simulated job, the engineer who is 
training themselves cannot leave or do anything. The best way to get
employed is to train like you're employed, and LeetOps is the ultimate
way to do it. 
)

the engineers solve it and that is how they increase/decrease their LeetOps rating

the base rating for engineers is 100, the best of the best can reach ratings of much higher
